I love the [Quicknovel](https://github.com/LagradOst/QuickNovel) EPUB reader; I think it's fantastic! I used to use Window Phone Link, but after switching to Linux, I found this to be much easier to use. So, I decided to share it. Simply run and insert your IP:

```bash
chmod +x adb-ip-detector.sh
```  

### Requirements  

To use this script, install the following dependencies:  

#### On Arch Linux:  
```bash
sudo pacman -S android-tools scrcpy zenity
```  

#### On Ubuntu/Debian-based systems:  
```bash
sudo apt-get install android-tools scrcpy zenity
```  

#### On Fedora:  
```bash
sudo dnf install android-tools scrcpy zenity
```  

#### On openSUSE:  
```bash
sudo zypper install android-tools scrcpy zenity
```
